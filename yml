Here's a YAML script example using Ansible to check if a file exists, create it if it doesn't, and print a message. Ansible is a common use case for YAML in task automation.

file_check_create.yml
yaml
Copy code
---
- name: Check and create file if it doesn't exist
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Check if the file exists
      stat:
        path: /path/to/your/file.txt
      register: file_status

    - name: Create the file if it doesn't exist
      file:
        path: /path/to/your/file.txt
        state: touch
      when: not file_status.stat.exists

    - name: Print message if the file was created
      debug:
        msg: "The file was created successfully!"
      when: not file_status.stat.exists

    - name: Print message if the file already exists
      debug:
        msg: "The file already exists!"
      when: file_status.stat.exists
How it works:
stat Module: Checks if the file exists and saves the result in the file_status variable.
file Module: Creates the file if it doesn't exist (state set to touch).
debug Module: Prints different messages based on whether the file existed or was created.
Running the script:
To execute this playbook, save it to a file (e.g., file_check_create.yml) and run it using Ansible:

bash
Copy code
ansible-playbook file_check_create.yml
Replace /path/to/your/file.txt with the actual file path you want to check or create.
