- name: Create multiple users
  hosts: localhost
  become: yes  # Ensures tasks are run with elevated privileges (if needed)
  tasks:
    - name: Create 10 users in a loop
      user:
        name: "user{{ item }}"
        state: present
      with_sequence: start=1 end=10
Explanation:
user Module: Used to manage user accounts in the system. Setting state: present ensures the user is created if it doesnâ€™t already exist.
with_sequence: Generates a sequence of numbers from start=1 to end=10, which is used to create usernames like user1, user2, ..., user10.
become: yes: Ensures the script has the necessary privileges to create users (e.g., root access).
Running the script:
Save it to a file, e.g., create_users.yml, and run it with Ansible:

bash
Copy code
ansible-playbook create_users.yml
Result:
This will create users named user1, user2, ..., user10 on the target system. Adjust start and end in the with_sequence loop if you need a different range.
